# Tarot Card Picker

This project is a React-based Tarot card picker created with **Vite**. It allows users to draw Tarot cards online and easily generate prompts for ChatGPT to interpret the results.

## Motivation

I created this project for the following reasons:

1. **Interest in Tarot**: I recently developed an interest in Tarot cards, but I don't own a physical deck (introduced to me by a friend).
2. **Learning Tarot**: As a beginner, I struggle to interpret the cards' meanings, so this app makes it convenient to draw cards online and generate results that ChatGPT can explain.
3. **Experimenting with Vite**: I wanted to try Vite as an alternative to Create React App, which has not been updated for a while.
4. **Enhancing CSS Animation Skills**: This project allowed me to practice and implement intensive CSS animations without relying on JavaScript.
5. **Graphic Design Challenge**:
   - I designed the **magic circle** that symbolizes the summoning of the cards.
   - I also created the **back of the cards**.
   - The **front of the cards** are sourced from free resources.

## How to Use

1. **Ask a Question**:
   Enter a question you'd like to ask about your life, such as "What guidance do I need for my career path?"

2. **Draw the Cards**:
   Click the button to draw three cards representing the **past**, **present**, and **future**.

3. **Generate a Prompt for ChatGPT**:
   Click "Ask ChatGPT to explain it" to generate a structured prompt. The prompt is automatically copied to your clipboard.

4. **Interpret the Results**:
   Paste the prompt into ChatGPT and let it provide a detailed analysis of your Tarot reading.

## Future Improvements (roadmap)

- **Add Reversed Card Support**: Include the option to draw reversed cards and their meanings. I haven't learnt that yet so there is not support for this for now.
- **Enhanced Animations**: Introduce additional effects like card shuffling or deck drawing.
